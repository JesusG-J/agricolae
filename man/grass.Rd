\description{
Twelve homeowners are selected randomly to participate in an experiment with
a plant nursery. Each homeowner is asked to select four fairly identical
areas in his yard and to plant four different types of grasses, one in each
area.

Each of the 12 blocks consists of four fairly identical plots of land, each
receiving care of approximately the same degree of skill because the four
plots are presumably cared for by the same homeowern.
